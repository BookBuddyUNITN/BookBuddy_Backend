changes:
	added CopiaLibroInterface, with field ISBN to identify the correct book
	modified location to be locationInterface instead of string
	modified addCopiaLibro to return a boolean value, that represents success or failure in writing to the db

problems:
	when deleting a copiaLibro, how do i differentiate between two copies that have the same ISBN?
		return ID and store those IDs locally for users
